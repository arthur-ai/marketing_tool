# Docker Compose with Redis
#
# ⚠️ NOTE: As of Phase 2, Redis is REQUIRED and included in the main docker-compose.yml
# This file is kept for backwards compatibility but is NO LONGER NEEDED.
#
# Usage (legacy): docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.redis.yml up
# New usage: Just use docker-compose.yml directly
