IMPORTANT: Identify the SINGLE most important keyword (main_keyword) that should be the primary focus for this content. This should be:
- The most relevant keyword for the content
- The keyword with the best balance of search volume and competition
- The keyword that best represents the main topic
- A keyword that can realistically rank (difficulty score 20-70)

Then extract:

1. Main keyword (1): The single most important keyword
   - Must be included in primary_keywords list
   - Should have estimated search volume > 100/month
   - Difficulty score should be between 20-70 for achievable ranking

2. Primary keywords (3-5 total, including main_keyword):
   - Main keywords for the content
   - Each should have metadata: search_volume, difficulty_score, relevance_score
   - Prioritize keywords with good volume/difficulty ratio

3. Secondary keywords (5-10):
   - Supporting keywords with lower search volume but high relevance
   - Include semantic variations and synonyms
   - Each should have metadata with search_volume and difficulty_score

4. LSI keywords (5-10):
   - Semantically related terms for content depth
   - Terms that frequently co-occur with primary keywords
   - Contextually relevant to the main topic

5. Long-tail keywords (5-8):
   - Specific, less competitive keyword opportunities
   - Question-based keywords (what, how, why, when, where)
   - Include geographic or modifier variations if relevant
   - Example: "how to [main keyword]", "best [main keyword] for [audience]"

6. Keyword density analysis:
   - Calculate current density for each primary keyword
   - Recommend optimal density (1-3% for primary, 0.5-1% for secondary)
   - Identify placement locations (title, H1, first paragraph, etc.)
   - Provide keyword_density_analysis with current_density, optimal_density, occurrences, and placement_locations

7. Search intent classification:
   - Categorize as: informational, transactional, navigational, or commercial
   - Provide reasoning for intent classification

8. Keyword difficulty assessment:
   - Provide numeric score (0-100) for each keyword in keyword_difficulty Dict
   - Consider competition level, domain authority needed, content quality required
   - Flag keywords with difficulty > 70 as "challenging"
   - Include difficulty_score in keyword metadata

9. Search volume estimates:
   - Provide realistic monthly search volume estimates
   - Use industry benchmarks and content context
   - Mark low-volume keywords (< 100/month) appropriately
   - Include search_volume in keyword metadata

10. Keyword clusters:
    - Group related keywords by topic/thematic similarity
    - Identify parent-child keyword relationships
    - Map keyword hierarchy
    - Provide keyword_clusters with cluster_name, keywords, primary_keyword, and topic_theme

11. Optimization recommendations:
    - Specific actions to improve keyword performance
    - Content gaps to fill
    - Keyword placement suggestions
    - Provide optimization_recommendations as a list of actionable items

12. Search volume summary:
    - Calculate total estimated monthly search volume by keyword category
    - Provide search_volume_summary Dict with totals for primary, secondary, long_tail

Focus on keywords that will drive organic traffic while maintaining natural, high-quality content. Ensure all metadata fields are populated for primary, secondary, and long-tail keywords.
