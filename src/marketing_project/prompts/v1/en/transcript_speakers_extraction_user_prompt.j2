## Extraction Task

### 1. Extract Speaker Names
- **CRITICAL**: Use the FULL transcript content (not just summaries) to extract speaker names
- Analyze the entire content to identify speaker names
- Look for patterns like:
  - "Name:" (e.g., "Pranav Shikarpur: You're the expert...")
  - Standalone names on lines after timestamps (e.g., timestamp line followed by "Pranav Shikarpur" on next line)
  - "Name said:", "Name -", etc.
  - Names in metadata or separate fields
- Extract ALL unique speaker names you find throughout the entire transcript
- Deduplicate - ensure each speaker appears only once in the list

### 2. Validate Speaker Names
- **Required**: At least one speaker must be present
- Each speaker name should be:
  - Non-empty
  - Reasonable length (1-50 characters)
  - Not generic placeholders like "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2" (unless no better names available)
  - Consistent naming throughout transcript
- Names should be actual names or meaningful identifiers

### 3. Quality Assessment
- Assess confidence in extraction
- Note any issues with speaker identification
- Flag if only generic names found or if extraction is uncertain

## Response Requirements

Provide your extraction results, including:
- **Extracted speakers**: List of all unique speaker names found
- **Validation status**: Whether speakers are valid according to criteria
- **Confidence score**: Your confidence in the extraction quality (0-1)
- **Issues found**: List any speaker-specific issues (empty if valid)

**Important Notes**:
- If only generic names like "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2" are found, extract them but note in validation_issues
- If no speakers can be identified, return empty list and flag as invalid
- Always attempt extraction before flagging as invalid
