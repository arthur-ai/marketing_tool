## Validation and Extraction Task

**IMPORTANT**: If any data is missing, you MUST attempt to extract it from the content before flagging as invalid. Additionally, you MUST perform comprehensive sentiment analysis and content analysis.

### 1. Title Validation
- **If title is present**: Validate that it's descriptive and reasonable length (10-200 chars)
- **If title is MISSING or invalid**:
  - Flag as critical issue
  - Suggest title generation in `approval_suggestions`
  - Set `title_validated: false`

### 2. Content Validation
- **If content is present**: Check readability, completeness, and minimum length (100 words)
- **If content is MISSING or invalid**:
  - Flag as critical issue
  - Set `content_validated: false`
  - Require approval

### 3. Author Validation and Extraction
- **If author is present**: Validate that name is reasonable
- **If author is MISSING**:
  - **CRITICAL**: Use the FULL blog post content to extract author name
  - Look for patterns like "by Author", "Author:", "Written by", etc.
  - Check metadata for author information
  - Extract author name from content if found
  - Include extracted author in your response's `author` field
  - Set `author_validated: true` if you successfully extract author

### 4. Category Validation and Extraction
- **If category is present**: Validate that it's reasonable
- **If category is MISSING**:
  - Analyze the content to infer category (technology, business, lifestyle, etc.)
  - Check metadata for category information
  - Extract category from content if found
  - Include extracted category in your response's `category` field
  - Set `category_validated: true` if you successfully extract category

### 5. Tags Validation and Extraction
- **If tags are present**: Validate that tags are reasonable
- **If tags are MISSING or empty**:
  - Extract hashtags from content (#tag patterns)
  - Extract key topics as potential tags
  - Generate relevant tags based on content analysis
  - Include extracted tags in your response's `tags` field
  - Set `tags_validated: true` if you successfully extract at least one tag

### 6. Word Count and Reading Time Calculation
- **If word count is present**: Validate that it's reasonable
- **If word count is MISSING**:
  - Calculate word count from content
  - Include calculated word count in your response's `word_count` field
- **If reading time is MISSING**:
  - Calculate reading time from word count (~200 words per minute)
  - Include calculated reading time in your response's `reading_time` field

### 7. Snippet Generation
- **If snippet is present**: Validate that it provides meaningful preview
- **If snippet is MISSING**:
  - Generate snippet from first paragraph or content summary
  - Keep to 100-200 characters
  - Note in `approval_suggestions` that snippet was generated

### 8. Sentiment Analysis (REQUIRED)
- **Perform comprehensive sentiment analysis**:
  - Analyze overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
  - Calculate sentiment score (-1.0 to 1.0)
  - Determine sentiment confidence (0-1)
  - Identify emotional tone (professional, casual, technical, friendly, etc.)
  - If content has clear sections, analyze sentiment per section
- **Include all sentiment fields** in your response

### 9. Content Analysis (REQUIRED)

### 12. Overall Quality Assessment
- After extraction attempts, assess overall quality

- Only require approval if critical data (title, content) cannot be extracted or content is unreadable
- Include all analysis results even if approval not required
